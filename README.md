# Web-page
This is the repo for my web page created in my web programming class

Each homework includes a summary as to what we had learned in the classes before the assignments were done.

The projects include finished working webpages that use different types of programming, from PHP, HTML and CSS.

index.html is the main page that should be accessed first.
