<h1> 4PF Records Sweepstakes Registration Form</h1>
<h2> You can have 4 pockets full like Lil Baby for a day!</h2>
<h3> Take a chance, enter your name and email to sign up to see if you're 4PF!</h3>

<strong>SUMMARY:</strong> 
The whole objective of this assignment was to use what we learned about forms while keeping php in mind to access information after submitting to our html page! 
Forms are used to take information and data that is imported by the user themselves.
We must also make sure that our PHP works hand in hand with our html like we were supposed to in Project 3 as well.
