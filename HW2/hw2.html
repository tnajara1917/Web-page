		<h2><strong>Summary:</strong></h2>
		<h3>What we had learned within our CSS session was how to add some color to our pages.
		In some sense, we learned, in short, how to take our basic looking HTML pages to new levels.
		We used font styles, color codes and names, color coding tables,etc... but most importantly--
		We learned how to take our code from our CSS File and link it to our HTML pages so that the page itself 
		can resemble the stlye based on what was put on the CSS stylesheet.</h3>
